# International Student Family Housing Site Selection in Christchurch

This project implements a **GIS-based spatial accessibility model** to identify suitable housing areas for international student families with primary school-aged children, who do not own private vehicles in Christchurch, New Zealand.  

Developed as part of the **GISC412 course (2025)** at the University of Canterbury.

---

## ðŸ§­ Objectives
- Build a reproducible spatial analysis framework for housing site selection.
- Evaluate accessibility to **primary schools, University of Canterbury, and bus stops**.
- Generate composite suitability maps highlighting top residential zones.

---

## ðŸ“Š Data & Methods
- **Data sources**: Stats NZ (SA2, meshblock), OpenStreetMap (road network, schools, bus stops), Wikipedia (school list).  
- **Tools**: Python (GeoPandas, OSMnx, NetworkX, Pandas, Matplotlib, Contextily), Jupyter Notebook.  
- **Workflow**:
  1. Extract and clean open-source data.
  2. Build pedestrian network (1.2 m/s walking speed).
  3. Compute **network-based isochrones** (UC 40 min, schools 15 min, bus stops 15 min).
  4. Overlay and weight suitability (Schools 0.50, UC 0.35, Bus 0.15).
  5. Classify into five levels (Very Low â†’ Very High).
  6. Produce final maps and SA2-based summaries.
